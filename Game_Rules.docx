EUCHRE
Number of Players:
Game is played with 4 players playing 2 versus 2. Partners sit opposite each other.
The Pack:
The game is played 32 total cards: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7 of each suit.
Rank of Cards:
Trump is a designated high-suit. The highest trump is the jack of the trump suit, called the "right bower." The second-highest trump is the jack of the other suit of the same color called the "left bower." (Example: If diamonds are trumps, the right bower is J? and left bower is J?.) The remaining trumps, and also the plain suits, rank as follows: A (high), K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7.
The Deal:
A random person is chosen to be the initial dealer. The cards are dealt clockwise, to the left, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer. Each player receives five cards. After the first deal, the deal passes to the player on the dealer's left.
The Turn-up:
On completing the deal, the dealer places the rest of the pack in the center of the table and turns the top card face up. The face up card designates the trump suit. 
Object of the Game:
The goal is to win at least three hands, called tricks. If dealer?s team fails to get three tricks, they are "euchred." Winning all five tricks is called a "march."
The Play:
The opening lead is made by the player to the dealer's left. If he can, each player must follow suit to a lead. If unable to follow suit, the player may trump or discard any card. A trick is won by the highest card of the suit led, or, if it contains trumps, by the highest trump. The winner of a trick leads next. 
Possible Strategies:
1. When possible, trump with highest trump in hand.
2. When possible, trump with lowest trump in hand. 
3. When possible, lead with highest card. 
4. When possible, lead with lowest card. 
5. When following suit, save highest cards for last. 
6. When following suit, play highest card possible. 
7. When not following suit (hand does not contain played suit) play lowest trump.
8. When not following suit (hand does not contain played suit) play highest trump.
9. When not following suit (hand does not contain played suit) play lowest non-trump card.
10. If a partner is winning the hand, play off (i.e. play lowest card possible).
11. If partner is winning the hand and there is another player that still needs to play then play a higher card if possible. 
These strategies can be played in combination between partners. For example, one partner will follow strategy 1 while the other plays with strategy 2. 
Scoring:
The following shows all scoring situations: 
Dealer?s team wins 3 or 4 tricks 1
Dealer?s team wins 5 tricks 2
Dealer?s team is euchred, opponents score 2
The first team to score 7 points wins the game.
